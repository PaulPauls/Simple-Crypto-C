Very simple and highly documented implementation of the Advanced Encryption 
Standard (AES) in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode, that follows pretty 
straightforward the official implementation guide in the NIST document FIPS 197.

This implementation is intended for understandability and readability for the
purpose of teaching. Feedback welcome.
