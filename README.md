Implementation of various cryptographic functions with demos
============================================================



### Any bugfixes or suggestions for improvement are highly welcome and appreciated!
Improvements of the following kind (no matter how small) are especially welcome:
- Bugs
- Improvements on Understandability
- Improvements on Speed without reducing understandability
- Improvements on Coding Style

This Crypto Implementation is not intended for maximal speed or minimal use of memory
but rather for a good understandability of the code

In the following months I intend to implement (ordered by priority):
- AES256_ECB decrypt
- Refined Makefile
- AES256_CBC
- AES192, AES128
- RSA
- Key Exchange, InputOutput, ECDH, etc
