## Very simple and highly documented implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode

The implementaiton follows pretty straightforward the official implementation guide in the NIST document [FIPS 197](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.197.pdf).

*This implementation is intended for understandability and readability for the purpose of teaching.* Feedback welcome.
