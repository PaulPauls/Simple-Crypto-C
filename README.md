Implementation of various cryptographic functions with demos
============================================================

### Any bugfixes or suggestions for improvement are highly welcome and appreciated!
Improvements of the following kind (no matter how small) are especially welcome:
- Bugs
- Improvements on Understandability
- Improvements on Speed without reducing understandability
- Improvements on Coding Style


This Crypto Implementation is not intended for maximal speed or minimal use of
memory but rather for a good understandability of the code.
Therefore I highly recommend to only use the implementations to learn about
their behaviour in code and to actually **use expert implementations** from
libressl and openssl in code. Expert implementations are faster and are tested
against side-channel attacks.
Demo files and detailed comments show how to call and use the library functions.
